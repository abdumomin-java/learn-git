Dear Friend, We cannot control fate and fortune. In order to achieve temporary success, if we have
good intentions and envy the achievements of people around us, if we work on ourselves and do not 
stop working, the blessing  that the Merciful and Merciful God will give us will surely increase, 
In Shaa Allah ☝🏻🕋
